# c1-updated

**PURPOSE**
The Horiseon web page had prewritten code with a few flaws. 

**SOME CHANGES MADE**
This html file was updated to have better html semantics, instead of simply using div, a header, footer, and article sections were used appropriately to ensure the page is more universally browser friendly. 
A few broken links were fixed and alts were added to the images to allow the page to have better assessability standards.
